Open terminal 1:

    - cd frontend
    - npm run dev
    - NOTE: If having issues, try running "npm install" then "npm run dev"

Open terminal 2:

    - cd server
    - node --env-file=.env index.js

To run the server, you need to have XAMPP installed (https://www.apachefriends.org/)
Once installed and when you are in the controll panel, start "Apache" and "MySQL".
Then, select "Admin" under "MySQL" and that should bring up the localhost phpMyAdmin.

You then need to make a database. For database name, do "authentication".

 - New
 - Database name should be "authentication". Then click create.
 - Table name should be "users". Then click create.
 - For table creation
    -     Name         Type         Length              A_I
        - id           int                           "Select it"
        - email        VARCHAR        30
        - username     VARCHAR        40
        - password     VARCHAR       150

 - Save

At the moment, the server is used for login and register. First try and make a fake account through register, and refresh phpMyAdmin to see if info was uploaded. If it did, try to login using same information.

It should work now. Message if anything is broken.
